### Anchor variables
The anchor values are based on four bits: CV, CH, AY, and AX  
CCAA - Center vertical, Center horizontal, Anchor vertical, Anchor horizontal  
VHYX - Y/vertical: 0 = top, 1 = bottom	X/horizontal: 0 = left, 1 = right

| Name | Value | Binary |
|---|--:|--:|
| `top_left` | 0 | `0000` |
| `top_right` | 1 | `0001` |
| `bottom_left` | 2 | `0010` |
| `bottom_right` | 3 | `0011` |
| `center_top` | 4 | `0100` |
| `center_bottom` | 6 | `0110` |
| `center_left` | 8 | `1000` |
| `center_right` | 9 | `1001` |
| `center` | 12 | `11**` |

### Fill variables
The fill values are based on five bits: RA, FV, FH, TV, and TH  
RFFTT - Ratio, Fit vertical, Fit horizontal, Tile vertical, Tile horizontal  
AVHVH - vertical: 0 = top, 1 = bottom	horizontal: 0 = left, 1 = right

| Name | Value | Binary | Description |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| `none` | 0 | `00000` | original size |
| `htile` | 1 | `00001` | tile horizontally |
| `vtile` | 2 | `00010` | tile vertically |
| `hstr` | 4 | `00100` | resize horizontally to fit the area |
| `vstr` | 8 | `01000` | resize vertically to fit the area |
| `hstra` | 20 | `10100` | resize horizontally to fit the area while keeping aspect ratio |
| `vstra` | 24 | `11000` | resize vertically to fit the area while keeping aspect ratio |
| `htile_vtile` | 3 | `00011` | tile the entire area (htile + vtile) |
| `vtile_hstr` | 6 | `00110` | resize horizontally to fit the area and tile vertically (hstr + vtile) |
| `htile_vstr` | 9 | `01001` | resize vertically to fit the area and tile horizontally (htile + vstr) |
| `hstr_vstr` | 12 | `01100` | resize to fill the entire area (hstr + vstr) |
| `vtile_hstra` | 22 | `11001` | resize horizontally to fit the area and tile vertically while keeping aspect ratio (vtile + hstra) |
| `htile_vstra` | 25 | `11001` | resize vertically to fit the area and tile horizontally while keeping aspect ratio (htile + vstra) |
| *missing* | 28 | `11100` | resize to fill the entire area while keeping aspect ratio (hstra + vstra) |


## Colors
Colors are hex strings in the format `0xAABBGGRR` where `AA` is optional transparency triggered when `AA >= 0x7E`

| Color | Code |
|---|--:|
| white | `0xFFFFFF` |
